# Assignment_Exploring-Machine-Learning-Models-with-Python_Supervised
This repository is a work in progress for my assignment on exploring various supervised machine learning models using Python. The objective of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of machine learning algorithms and their application in solving real-world problems. Currently, the project is in the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) stage.

## Key Features (To be updated):

a. Dataset Selection: I am carefully selecting a relevant dataset that aligns with the objectives of the assignment.

b. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The project is currently focused on performing EDA to gain insights into the dataset. This includes tasks such as data cleaning, handling missing values, visualizing distributions and relationships among variables, and identifying potential outliers or anomalies.

c. Preprocessing and Feature Engineering: Once the EDA stage is complete, I will proceed with comprehensive preprocessing steps, such as scaling, encoding categorical variables, and feature selection.

d. Model Implementation: I plan to implement a variety of supervised machine learning models to explore their performance on the dataset. The initial list of models includes:
*  Linear Regression
*  Decision Tree Regressor
*  Random Forest Regressor
*  XGBoost Regressor
*  Ridge Regression
*  Lasso Regression

e. Model Evaluation: Each model's performance will be assessed using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE) or R-squared (R^2) score.

f. Model Comparison: I will conduct a thorough comparison of the different models, analyzing their strengths, weaknesses, and suitability for the given problem.

d. Documentation: The repository will include a detailed report or Jupyter Notebook explaining the EDA process, methodology, model implementation, results, and insights gained from the project.

Please note that this repository is a work in progress, and updates will be made regularly as I progress through the different stages. Feel free to explore the code, provide suggestions, or contribute to the project by implementing additional models or suggesting improvements.

Note: Update this description with specific details about your dataset, EDA findings, models implemented, and any other relevant information as you continue working on the project.
